                <li><strong>Platform Points Are Non-Refundable:</strong> The non-monetary digital points used for community engagement have no cash value and are not eligible for any form of refund. Subscription payments are for platform access only.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Errors:</strong> If you were charged due to a verified technical error on our platform and did not receive access to the subscribed services, we will issue a full refund upon verification.</li>
