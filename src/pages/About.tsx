            <p className="text-lg text-qb-dark-gray leading-relaxed">
              Quant Basket was founded in 2025 by a team of technologists and community builders who saw a need for better engagement tools. We observed that creators, non-profits, and educational institutions were searching for effective ways to recognize member contributions and foster participation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-qb-dark-gray leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Our platform was built to solve this challenge. We provide a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that allows any organization to create and manage its own system of digital points for recognition, granting access to benefits, and facilitating community pollingâ€”all powered by secure and transparent technology.
